# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

Initial system, seeded from the VCP Figma Variables export (Aug 2026).

- Core: 10 colour ramps (vcp-blue, slate, neutral, blue, green, red, yellow,
  pink-legacy, teal-legacy, monochrome), 14-step px spacing scale, Poppins/Inter.
- Semantic (light + dark): `surface.*`, `text.*`, `stroke.*`,
  `action.{primary,secondary,tertiary}`, `accent.{critical,success,warning,info,blue,green,red}`
  in filled/outline/tonal styles — 228 tokens per theme.
- Type ramp: display-xl … caption-sm as composite tokens → `text-*` utilities.
- Shape: radius sm/md/pill, shadows card/raised/menu/modal.
- Build targets: Tailwind v4 `@theme` CSS + `.dark` overrides, plain CSS vars,
  TypeScript, flat + nested JSON.
- Components: `Button` (primary/secondary/tertiary/danger/link × sm/md/lg,
  loading/disabled), mapped to `action.*` and `accent.critical.*` state tokens.

### Not imported from the Figma export (deliberately)

- `schemes-*` and `state-layers-*` variables — Material theme-builder noise.
- `-2`/`-3` duplicate variables — Figma collection duplication artifacts.
- `button-*` component variables — they referenced the pink `primary` ramp;
  design confirmed (2026-08-18) pink is not a brand colour. The pink ramp is
  removed entirely; `action.*` (vcp-blue) is the button source.

### Contrast fixes vs the Figma export (approved by design, 2026-08-18)

- `text.subtle`: slate-400 → slate-500 (was 2.56:1 on white — failed AA).
- `text.tertiary`: slate-500 → slate-600 (keeps the hierarchy distinct after the
  subtle fix; 7.58:1).
- `accent.success.tonal.content.default`: green-800 → green-900 (was exactly
  4.50:1; now 8.24:1).
- Dark theme: `stroke.focused` was left at vcp-blue-500, the same value as light,
  while every other `stroke.*` token was inverted. That is 2.37:1 against the dark
  surfaces — below the 3:1 WCAG 1.4.11 asks of a focus indicator, so the focus ring
  was close to invisible in dark theme on every component, Button included.
  Now vcp-blue-300 (6.33:1), mirroring how `stroke.brand.strong` flips 600 → 300.
  This corrects the earlier "dark theme already passes" note.
- These fixes live in `scripts/import-figma-tokens.mjs`, so re-importing a fresh
  Figma export cannot silently regress them. **Push the same three changes back
  to the Figma variables** so the export catches up with the code.
